Exploring significant relationships between the ball, boost, and best in the game of Rocket League.

## Why am I interested?
Wow! Quite simply, I love the game.  Rocket League's major appeal to me is its core pillar of being easy to pick up while maintaining itself as a bonified eSport with an incredible skill ceiling.
