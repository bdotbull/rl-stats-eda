Examining tyre compound significance with regard to leaderboard standings in Formula DRIFT.
#
#
## Why am I interested?
Drifting was a passion for me before I even knew the word for it.  The feeling of a controlled slide, regardless of surface conditions, is exhilarating.  I happened to catch the first ever televised drifting event in the USA in 2004 and have watched many events in person since 2010.
#
## Where will I get the data?
The data will come from the main [FD website](http://www.formulad.com/).  The site has recently changed what driver profiles look like [(example here)](http://www.formulad.com/drivers/vaughn-gittin-jr), so I will need to visit various other sites like wheelwell [(wheelwell for example driver from above)](https://wheelwell.com/formulad/2sp6/2019-ford-mustang)

#
## What will the data look like?
Vehicle sponsership information, tyre size, tyre sponser, leaderboard points, event wins, event placement

#

## Some ideas on statistical tests
Two main hypothesis include:

##### _H0 = A driver on Falken tyres is more likely to win than a driver not on Falken tyres_



#
### If time permits I would like to...
Expand my sample size
